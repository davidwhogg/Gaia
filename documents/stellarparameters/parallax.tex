\title{What can you learn about a star from its parallax?}
\author{DWH, HWR, others}

\begin{abstract}
The \gaia\ Mission is about to release precise parallax measurements
for hundreds of thousands of stars.
A parallax measurement delivers information about the distance (from
\gaia's orbit) to the star, but here we ask what it tells us about the
intrinsic physical properties of the star.
The answer to this question is technically \emph{subjective}: It depends on
what other information you know (or believe you know) about the star.
If you have calibrated multi-band photometry across the ultraviolet to
near infrared, the parallax (with only weak spectral assumptions)
delivers information about the stellar bolometric luminosity.
If you believe stellar photosphere models, the parallax delivers
information about stellar radius and effective temperature, and even
more precisely if you have spectroscopic data on the star.
If you believe stellar evolution and stellar structure models
(isochrones or tracks), the parallax also delivers information about
surface gravity, mass, composition, and age.
With other data (interferometry, asteroseismology, or binary-orbit
timing, for examples), even more can be learned.
We illustrate these points with toy data and give some practical
advice for those using the \gaia\ data to improve our knowledge of
stars.
The main point is that there are no assumption-free inferences, and
every new kind of inference brings with it new kinds of
model-dependence.

%% \begin{abstract}
%% Perhaps the most physically informative measurement to take of
%% an unresolved star is a high resolution spectrum, which can be used
%% to constrain the local stellar photospheric parameters (effective
%% temperature and surface gravity to first order), using a stellar
%% photosphere model.
%% These infererences can be helped by, but do not in any way require
%% the use of, a stellar evolution model or tracks.
%% Spectroscopic surveys often choose to model stellar
%% spectra using photosphere models only, with no input of evolution
%% models.
%% The \gaia\ Mission is about to release precise parallaxes for hundreds
%% of thousands of stars!
%% When combined with photometry or spectrophotometry, these parallaxes
%% deliver information about bolometric luminosity and surface gravity;
%% they hold great promise for improving inferences about stars.
%% Here we make the general properties of these inferences explicit with
%% a graphical model and discussion.
%% Any use of a parallax
%% to learn about stellar parameters necessarily requires the use not
%% just of a photosphere model, but also a stellar-evolution
%% model.
%% Once an evolution model is used in conjunction with the parallax
%% inference, it is inconsistent (and wrong) not to also include the
%% evolution model in the spectrum inference (that is, require the
%% effective temperature and surface gravity to lie on evolutionary
%% tracks or isochrones).
%% That is, the presence of the \gaia\ data will force changes to how
%% we analyze spectral data.
%% We give some unsolicited advice, and perform some demonstrations with toy data.
